# Portfolio Preview

I noticed a trend growing towards bento box in UX and I wanted to try this for my portfolio. You can visit the site (https://kapilsh.netlify.app/). It feels very convenient in a way that all the information you are looking for is served for you. Apple inspired me to design my portfolio is such manner

As you can use CSS Flexbox to arrange those boxes accordingly, which makes it easier for development as well. With React I can make those cards as a reusable component and pass the content either as a children or as an attribute. The height and width is decided according to the flex grow property which I decided to give manually based on the design.

I will be developing the subsequent tiles with future releases. I decided to keep it this way because I wanted to inculcate Agile development process and this will help me do that.
